# opencv_turret

In order to track a target , we have decided to design “TURRET”. It is able to catch the movement of a living being.We decided to make a turret which
first identifies an object, locks it as a
target and then the laser follows the
path of the target, providing an
innovative touch of opencv to a simple turret.
